# React_Portfolio

This is a project that I have built from scratch. I needed to write all of the html code as well as all of the css code. I am making this project in order to have a well made portfolio that can be viewed in the future by prospective employers. It also will serve as a convenient place to save some of my best projects. I intend to update this page throughout my time doing the bootcamp, as I complete more projects and improve my skills in web development.

This project was made as practice for setting up a website without any starter code. In this project, I learned a lot about styling various elements on my page, and how to use different display types to put things where i wanted them to be onn the website. Additionally, I learned how to make it so that buttons contain links to other websites, and I can now link to my other work. Another fun thing that I learned was using unicode values to get emojis onto the webpage.

Throughout building this, there have been many bugs that have had to be dealt with. Most of these occured when moving my code from VSCode to Github. Therefore there are a lot of commits in this repo, many of which may have been slightly unnecessary. I have had trouble getting my html and css to actually show up when I visit the deployed site. Additionally, sometimes when i upload to github, my deployed website only shows my readme page. This has taught me that I need to spend more time familiarizing myself with Github so that my uploads go more smoothly.
