        Welcome to my page! My name is Ian Corbett. For the last few years I have become very interested
        in coding and in the field of computer science. I am currently in the process of working through
        coding bootcamp, in order to improve my skills. My goal is to be able to do web development as a 
        profession at some point in the near future.
